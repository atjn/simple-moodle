# v1.1.0
- Significantly improved loading speed. This also makes the white flash shorter when reloading a page with dark mode enabled. It is unfortunately not feasible to completely remove it.
- Fixed page layout on subpages. They will now shrink to the middle of the screen if the content is narrow.
- Significantly improved general styling. Links are now styled correctly, eliminating the funky boxes behind them and the color flashes when hovering over them. More buttons now follow the default styling, which is especially important in dark mode, because they would be in light mode. There are many more minor styling improvements.
